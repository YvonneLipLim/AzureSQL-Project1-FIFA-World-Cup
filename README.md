## Importance of Kaggle Datasets for SQL and Data Visualization Practice:
Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and collaboration, offers a vast repository of diverse datasets. These datasets provide a valuable resource for practising SQL queries and creating visualizations, which can significantly enhance my data analysis skills. By actively engaging with these datasets, learners can receive feedback from other data professionals, which can help he/she improve their skills and learn new techniques.

## Key Objectives:

<h3>1. SQL Skill Development:</h3> 
By working with different datasets, learners can practice various SQL concepts such as:
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Manipulation</b>: Selection, Filtering, Sorting and Aggregating Data</li>
  <li><b>Applying Joins</b>: Combining data from multiple table</li>
  <li><b>Subqueries</b>: Nested query for complex data retrieval</li>
  <li><b>Windows Functions</b>: Performing calculations across rows of a result set</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>2. Data Visualization:</h3> 
By creating visualizations, learners can:
<ul>
  <li><b>Understand Data Patterns</b>: Identify trends, outliers and correlations</li>
  <li><b>Communicate Findings</b>: Effectively convey insights to others</li>
  <li><b>Explore Different Visualization Techniques</b>: Experiment with various charts and graphs to find the most suitable representation</li>
</ul>
